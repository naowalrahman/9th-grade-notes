|More control over what happens in empire|Less corruption 
|More unification of the empire|More overall satisfaction of the people
|Can be hard to find new king if there is no heir| The other king can easily take over

**Activity 2: Politics developered from the Words of Holy Scripture by Jacques Bossuet.**
1. Bossuet's thesis is that the relationship between kings and God is direct; kings are the highest level in terms of the mortal ground, but above them lies spirit and God himself. Kings have absolute authority, but only under the right of God. 
2. Evidence used to support Bossuet's thesis includes saying that royal power is absolute, and that, since God is infinite and God is all, and that all perfection and strength is united in God. Similarly, all the power of individuals is united in the person of the prince (the king). Essentially, the point is that the role of God in ruling the universe aligns with a king's role in ruling his country. 
3. According the Bossuet, the relationship between God and a king is that kings' power comes from God, and thus they should employ their power with fear and self-restraint. 
4. The only thing that limits a kings power is God's might.
