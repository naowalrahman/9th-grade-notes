# Evidence of Evolution

### Evidences to support Evolution Theory
- Fossils
- Comparative anatomy: the study of developing organisms in the period from fertilization to birth
- Biochemistry: Enzymes (cytochrome p450, hemoglobins, etc.) 
- Genetics: DNA/amino acid sequences (HOX genes, cytochrome c) 

### Evidence in Comparative Embryology
Homologous structure - two of the same structures in different animals with different function. 
Example: Vertebrate Embryos 
- All have gills which eventually become ear canals. 
- All have tails/tailbones. 
- All pass stages which represent larval fish. 

This just goes to show how, despite being completely different species, the same effect and result occur. This is as a result of convergent evolution. 

Example: Convergent Molecular Evolution of Lysozyme
- The number of amino acid differences in the lysozymes of several pairs of mammals are shown above the diagonal line; the numbers of similarities that arose from convergence between species are shown below the diagonal. 

### Genomic Evidence of Neutral Processes of Evolution
- **Neutral theory** - at the molecule level, the majority of variants in most populations are *selectively neutral*. 
- The rate of evolution of particular genes and proteins is often *relatively constant over time* and can be used as a **"molecular clock"** to calculate evolutionary divergence over time in a particular species. 

### Mechanism of Biological Speciation 
**Premating Isolating Mechanisms**:  factors that prevent organisms of two species from mating. 
- Geographic isolation: the species do not interbreed because a physical barrier separates them. 
- Ecological isolation: the species do not interbreed even if they are within the same area because they occupy different habitats. 
- Temporal isolation  

Two individuals, under natural conditions in their natural habitat, they will be able to mate and generate a viable and fertile offspring.
