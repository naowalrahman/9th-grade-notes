# Processes of Evolution 

15.2 Mutation, selection, Gene Flow, Genetic Drift, and Nonrandom Mating Result in Evolution
- Migration of individuals or movement of gametes (e.g. pollen) between populations results in gene flow, which can change allele frequencies. 
- **Genetic Drift** - random changes in allele frequencies from one generation to the next 

15.3 Evolution Can Be Measured by Changes in Allele Frequencies 
- Hardy Weinberg principle 

### Darwin's Contribution to Evolution Theory 

Darwin developed an explanatory theory for evolutionary change;: 
- Species change over time 
- Divergent species share a common ancestor (**descent with modification**) 

Mutations can be deleterious, beneficial, or have no effect (neutral). Because of mutation, different forms of a gene, alleles, may exist at a locus, hence, maintain genetic variation in populations. 

### Mutations Accumulate Continuously in a Population of *E. coli* 
- Lines of *E. coli* were grown in the laboratory for 20,000 generations, and genomes were sequenced every 5,000 generations. 
- The lines accumulated about 45 changes to their genomes, and these changes appeared at a fairly constant rate. 

In nature, the population of *E. coli* would not have a linear growth rate because there would be various limiting factors in their environment to prevent the population from growing indefinitely. These limiting factors include temperature, predators, and climate. 

### When Would Evolution *Not* Occur? 
**Hard Weinberg principle** ($p^2+2pq+q^2=1$):
> Allele and genotype frequencies within a sexually reproducing, diploid population will remain in equilibrium unless outside forces act to change those frequencies. 

To reach the ***equilibrium***, a population should have
1. No mutation 
2. Random mating 
3. No natural selection
4. Extremely large population size
6. No gene flow
